    <title>JBoss AS 5.x Integration</title>
    <para>Resteasy has no special integration with JBoss Application Server so it must be configured and
        installed
        like any other container. There are some issues though. You must make sure that there is not a copy
        of servlet-api-xxx.jar in your WEB-INF/lib directory as this may cause problems. Also, if you are running
        with JDK 6, make sure to filter out the JAXB jars as they come with JDK 6.

    you have to provide is your JAX-RS service classes packaged within a WAR either as POJOs, CDI beans,
    or EJBs and provide an empty web.xml file as follows:
