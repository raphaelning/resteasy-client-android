            Servlet 3.0 deployments within standalone Tomcat or Jetty can now use the Resteasy <literal>ServletContainerInitializer</literal>.
            This allows tighter integration with Resteasy much like you have within JBoss/Wildfly.  Check out the
            installation/configuration section of this document for more information.

            Form parameters are now read via a provider where earlier they were read from HttpServletRequest.getParameterMap().
            This may break deployments that depend on that behavior, i.e. if you have a servlet filter that calls that very method.
            For those situations I added the switch resteasy.use.container.form.params

            The JAX-RS TCK has become very strict with a ton more tests.  I can't remember them all, but there are a number

        <listitem>
            The JAX-RS 2.0 TCK has become very very strict in terms of the matching algorithm.  Unfortunately, the matching
            algorithm is quite poor so there are a number of resource schemes that will no longer match.
            For example, resource classes are scanned for a best match, other are ignored in the match.
            Resource locators are not visited unless they are a best match over resource methods.  There is one config switch
            I added so that Resteasy will ignore the Spec defined class expression filtering step and instead match
            base on the full expressions of each JAX-RS method.  resteasy.wider.request.matching.  Set that to true
            and you will at least be able to avoid that.

            The JAX-RS 2.0 class ClientFactory no longer exists.  It has been replaced with ClientBuilder.  You can
            still call newClient(), but there is now an additional builder interface.  Likewise, there is no
            ResteasyClientFactory.  We also have an extension to ClientBuilder called ResteasyClientBuilder.  So docs
            for more details.

            Filter execution and exception handling now matches the JAX-RS 2.0 spec.  Exceptions thrown from filters/interceptors

            The constructors for ResteasyClient class are no longer public.  You need to use the new ResteasyClientBuilder
            class.  One thing to note is that when a ResteasyClient is created by a builder, it no longer
            uses ResteasyProviderFactory.getInstance(), but instead instantiates a new one.  This will probably
            not effect most uses.

            MultipartInput has a new close() method.  If you have a read body that is MultipartInput or one of

            these possible temporary files are deleted on GC or JDK shutdown.  Other multipart providers clean up

	  Some subtle changes were made to ExceptionMapper handling so that you can write ExceptionMappers for any exception thrown internally or within
	  your application.  See JIRA Issue RESTEASY-595 for more details.  This may have an effect on existing applications that have an ExceptionMapper
	  for RuntimeException in that you will start to see Resteasy internal exceptions being caught by this kind of ExceptionMapper.

            ClientRequest.getHeaders() always returns a copy. It also converts the values within
            ClientRequest.getHeadersAsObjects() to string. If you
            add values to the map returned by getHeaders() nothing happen. Instead add values to the
            getHeadersAsObjects() map. This allows non-string header objects
            to propagate through the MessageBodyWriter interceptor and ClientExecutor interceptor chains.
