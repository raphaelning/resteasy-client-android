JAX-RS, JSR-311, is a new JCP specification that provides a Java API for RESTful Web Services over the HTTP protocol.
    Resteasy is an portable implementation of this specification which can run in any Servlet container. Tighter
    integration with JBoss Application Server is also available to make the user experience nicer in that environment.
    While JAX-RS is only a server-side specification, Resteasy has innovated to bring JAX-RS to the client through the
    RESTEasy JAX-RS Client Framework. This client-side framework allows you to map outgoing HTTP requests to remote
    servers using JAX-RS annotations and interface proxies.
