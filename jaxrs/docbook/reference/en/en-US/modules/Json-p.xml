    <title>JSON Support via Java EE 7 JSON-P API</title>
    <para>No, this is not the JSONP you are thinking of!  JSON-P is a new Java EE 7 JSON parsing API.  Horrible name for
        a new JSON parsing API!  What were they thinking?  Anyways, Resteasy has
        a provider for it.  If you are using Wildfly, it is required by Java EE 7 so you will have it automatically bundled.
        Otherwise, use this maven dependency.

        It has built in support for JsonObject, JsonArray, and JsonStructure as request or response entities.  It should
        not conflict with Jackson or Jettison if you have that in your path too.
