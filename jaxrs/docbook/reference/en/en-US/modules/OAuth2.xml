    <title>OAuth 2.0 and Resteasy Skeleton Key</title>
    <para>
        The overall goal of Resteasy Skeleton Key is to provide a unified way for both Browser and JAX-RS clients
        to be secured in an integrated and seemless fashion.  We want to support a network of applications and
        services so that if one server needs to execute or forward requests to another, there is a secure and
        scalable way to do this without hitting a central authentication server each and every request.

        The <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</ulink> Authorization Framework enables a
        third-party to obtain access to an HTTP resource on behalf of a resource owner without the third-party
        having to know the credentials of the resource owner.  It does this by issuing access tokens via a browser
        redirect protocol, or by a direct grant.  The access tokens can then be transmitted by the <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-23">OAuth2 Bearer Token</ulink>
        protocol to access the protected resource.

        Resteasy Skeleton Key is an OAuth 2.0 implementation that allows you to use existing JBoss AS7 security infrastructure
        to secure your web applications and restful services.  You can turn an existing web app into an OAuth 2.0 Access
        Token Provider or you can turn a JBoss AS7 Security Domain into a central authentication and authorization
        server that a whole host of applications and services can use.  Here are the features in a nutshell:

                Access tokens are digitally signed by the oauth2 framework and can be used to access any service
                configured to work in the domain.  The tokens contain both identity and role mapping information.  Because
                they are digitally signed, there's no need to overload the central authentication server with each request
                to verify identity and to determine permissions.

        <para>The Resteasy distribution comes with an OAuth2 Skeleton key example.  This is a great way to see
            OAuth2 in action and how it is configured.  You may also want to use this as a template for your applications.

            This will ask you a series of questions that will be used to create the X509 public certificate. Basic PKI
            stuff that you hopefully are already familiar with.  Move this keystore file into a directory that you can
            reference from a configuration file.  I suggest the standalone/configuration directory of your JBoss AS7
            distribution.

        <title>Setting up the Auth Server</title>
        <para>The next thing you're gonna want to do is set up a web application to be your OAuth2 provider.
        This can be an existing web app or you can create a new WAR to be your central authentication server.
        An existing web app must be configured to use servlet FORM authentication.  Enabling OAuth2 within
        this app will not change how normal users interact with it.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Setting up your Security Domain</title>
            <para>
                You can use any set of JBoss AS7 login modules you want to store your username, passwords and role mappings.
                Each security domain will be comprised of regular users, oauth clients, and admins.  Oauth clients
                represent either a web application that wants to use the auth-server to do SSO, or they are traditional
                oauth clients that want access permision to act on behalf of another user (the traditional OAuth use case).
                Every oauth client must have a username, password, and a specific role mapping that gives them various permissions to
                participate in OAuth 2 protocols.  There is a role that grants an oauth client permission
                to login as a specific user (default is <literal>login</literal>.  This is the SSO case.  There is a role that grants a client permission
                to request permission to act on behalf of a user (default is <literal>oauth</literal>).  Additional
                role mappings assigned to the oauth client define what additional permissions they are allowed to have.  These
                additional permissions are the role mappings of the application and are the intersection of the permissions
                given to the user the client is acting on behalf of.  This is better explained by an example role mapping file:
           </para>
<programlisting>
wburke=user,admin
loginclient=login
oauthclient1=oauth,*
oauthclient2=oauth,user
</programlisting>
            <para>
                In the above role mapping file with have a simple user <literal>wburke</literal>.  He has application
                role permissions of <literal>user</literal> and <literal>admin</literal>.  One oauth client user
                is <literal>loginclient</literal>.  It has been given a role mapping of <literal>login</literal>.
                This client is allowed to login as the user and is given all roles of the user.  The <literal>oauthclient1</literal>
                user is not allowed to login as the user, but is allowed to obtain an OAuth grant to act on behalf of the
                user.  The <literal>*</literal> role means that <literal>oauthclient1</literal> is granted the same
                roles as the user it is acting on behalf of.  If <literal>oauthclient1</literal> acts on behalf of
                <literal>wburke</literal> then it will have both <literal>user</literal> and <literal>admin</literal> permissions.
                The <literal>oauthclient2</literal> is also allowed to use the oauth grant protocol, but it will only
                ever be granted <literal>user</literal> permissions.
            </para>
            <para>
                You are not confined to login, oauth, and * as role mapping names.  You can configure them to
                be whatever you want.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emphasis>Why have different login and oauth role mappings?</emphasis>  <literal>login</literal> clients
                are allowed to bypass entering username and password if the user has already logged in once and has
                an existing authenticated session with the server.  <literal>oauth</literal> clients are <emphasis>always</emphasis>
                required to enter username and password.  You probably don't want to grant permission automatically to
                an oauth client.  A user will want to look at who is requesting permission.  This role distinction
                gives you this capability.

            <title>Auth Server Config File</title>
            <para>You must create a configuration file that holds all the configuration for OAuth2.  This is json formatted

            directory of your war, that's all you have to do.  Otherwise, you must specify the full path

            <para>
                The best way to create the config file for your application is to ask the central authentication server
                you configured in the last section.  So, boot up the auth server and go to https://<emphasis>auth-server-context-root</emphasis>/j_oauth_realm_info.html.
                For example: <literal>https://localhost:8443/auth-server/j_oauth_realm_info.html</literal>. This will
                show template configurations depending on which valve you are using.  You want the <literal>OAuthManagedResourceValve</literal> config.
                It will look something like this.

        <title>Obtaining an access token programmatically.</title>
        <para>
            You can request an access token from the auth-server by doing a simple HTTPS invocation.  You must
            use BASIC authentication to identify your user, and you will get back a signed access token for that user.
            Here's an example using a JAX-RS 2.0 client:
        </para>
<programlisting>
    ResteasyClient client = new ResteasyClientBuilder()
                                .truststore(truststore)
                                .build();

    Form form = new Form().param("grant_type", "client_credentials");
    ResteasyWebTarget target = client.target("https://localhost:8443/auth-server/j_oauth_token_grant");
    target.configuration().register(new BasicAuthentication("bburke@redhat.com", "password"));
    AccessTokenResponse res = target.request()
                           .post(Entity.form(form), AccessTokenResponse.class);
</programlisting>
        <para>
           The above makes a simple POST to the context root of the auth server with <literal>j_oauth_token_grant</literal>
            at the end of the target URL.  This resource is responsible for creating access tokens.
        </para>
 <programlisting><![CDATA[
    try
    {
       Response response = client.target("https://localhost:8443/database/products").request()
                               .header(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION, "Bearer " + res.getToken()).get();
       String xml = response.readEntity(String.class);
    }
    finally
    {
       client.close();
    }
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            The access token is a simple string.  To invoke on a service protected by bearer token auth, just
            set the <literal>Authorization</literal> header of your HTTPS request with a value of <literal>Bearer</literal>
            and then the access token string.
        </para>

        <title>Access remote services securely in a secure web session</title>
        <para>
            If you have an application secured by one of the methods described in this chapter, you can obtain
            the access token of the current web session so that you can use it to invoke on other remote services
            securely using bearer token authentication.  Each HttpServletRequest in a secure web session has an attribute
            called <literal>org.jboss.resteasy.skeleton.key.SkeletonKeySession</literal> which points to an instance
            of a class with the same  name.  This class contains the access token and also points to the truststore
            you configured.  You can then extract this info and make secure remote invocations.  Here's an example of that.
        </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
