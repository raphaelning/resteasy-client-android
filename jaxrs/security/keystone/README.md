Skeleton Keystone IDM
=====================
This is a prototype of Openstack's Keystone protocol as well as a IDM server that provides a Keystone management interface.
Keystone seems to be a little bit of a moving target, so there's a high probability this code will not interoperate
with anything provided by Openstack.
